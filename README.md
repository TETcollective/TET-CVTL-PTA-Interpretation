# TET-CVTL-PTA-Interpretation
An alternative topological vacuum interpretation of the Pulsar Timing Array Hellings-Downs correlation in the TET–CVTL framework. The observed quadrupolar signal is compatible with collective phase fluctuations in a primordial lattice of unique three-leaf clover knots (trefoil 3₁, L_k = 6), without requiring propagating tensor gravitational waves.
